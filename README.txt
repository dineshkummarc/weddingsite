An installer is coming soon.

In the mean time, you can do the following to install:

1.) Upload files to a linux apache server
2.) Set up your codeigniter database in system/application/config/database.php
3.) Go through all files in:
	system/application/controllers
	system/application/views
	system/application/models
    ...and edit the values that were changed and marked with "CHANGE THIS".
4.) Create a database
5.) Initialize the db schema by running the install/wedding.sql file on the db.
6.) Delete the install directory.

All done!
